# LIVE-SENSOR-UPDATES-ON-GRAPHICAL-USER-INTERFACE-USING-PYTHON-AND-ARDUINO
In this project I have shown how we can display live sensor data on Graphical User Interface using Python and Arduino. 
In this project I have used a DHT-11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and a Soil Moisture Sensor.
Arduino and Python will communicate to each other Using Pyserial library.
You can now make your own Graphical User Interface and can easily check all the data coming from all the sensor's.
I have shown this Interface with just 3 different reading's but you can add more sensor's according to your project.
